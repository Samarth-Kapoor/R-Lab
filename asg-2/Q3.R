#Write an R function for computing conditional probability. Call this function to do
#the following problem:
#suppose the probability of the weather being cloudy is 40%. Also suppose the prob-
#ability of rain on a given day is 20% and that the probability of clouds on a rainy day
#is 85%. If itâ€™s cloudy outside on a given day, what is the probability that it will rain that day?
